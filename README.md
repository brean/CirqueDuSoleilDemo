# Cirque Du Soleil Demo
This is a small project inspired by the [Build 2017 Cirque du Soleil Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNz5Rw6TwCw)

# Features
This demo uses the HoloTool Kit-Demo to create, move and manipulate Holograms, just like the Holograms App (which is a bit different to the Cirque Du Soleil-demo but feels more consistent).

This demo shows the "creation menu" that uses a circle in the middle of the screen to create new elements, so I created a configurable circle segment:

From the creation menu you can select one of 3 basic elements (a cube, a mug or an arc)
